    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this digital world, job hunting is done through popular websites such as 'seek.com.au' and 'au.indeed.com'. These websites allow job searchers to search for their required positions using keywords, salaray ranges, company names, and job categories. From the sides of employers who post these jobs, the categorisation of job advertisements is done manually which often leads in jobs being incorrectly categorised and hence reducing their job visibility and their chance to gather suitable candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the goal to eliminate these issues, automated job classification systems incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) for increasing viability. These systems suggest suitable categories based on the textual content of the job advertisements, which increase accuracy by reducing human errors which in turn enhances the overall user experience on popular job hunting websites. The project aims to develop an automated job advertisement classification system though three key milestones. "
